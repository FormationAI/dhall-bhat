{-

Flip the value of an Either where `Right` goes to `Left`, and `Left` goes to `Right`.

Examples:
```
    let Either = ./Either/Type

in  let E = constructors (Either Text Natural)

in  ./Either/flipEither Text Natural (E.Left "ohno")
= < Right = "ohno" | Left : Natural >


    let Either = ./Either/Type

in  let E = constructors (Either Text Natural)

in  ./Either/flipEither Text Natural (E.Right 42)
= < Left = 42 | Right : Text >
```

-}
    let Either = ./Type

in    λ(a : Type)
    → λ(b : Type)
    →     let E = constructors (Either b a)
      
      in  ./fold a b (Either b a) E.Right E.Left
