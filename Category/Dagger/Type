{- A true †-category has a contravariant endofunctor on C that reverses the
   morphisms. I’m not sure how to implement that, so this structure simply uses
   pairs of morphisms as the morphism.

  λ(object : Kind)
→ λ(arrow : object → object → Type)
→ λ(a : object)
→ λ(b : object)
→ { _1 : arrow a b, _2 : arrow b a }
