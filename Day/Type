{- FIXME: This is supposed to be Day convolution, but I’m having trouble getting
          that to compile, so it’s currently composition. The last line should
          be replaced by something like:

          → ∀(b : object) → ∀(c : object) → { _1 : f b, _2 : g c, _3 : b → c → a }
-}
  λ(object : Kind)
→ λ(f : object → object)
→ λ(g : object → object)
→ λ(a : object)
→ f (g a)
